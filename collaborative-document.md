![David's graph of religious participation vs age](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows how participation in religious and spiritual activity in the USA is different at different ages.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which
respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.
The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages, who reported that they had spent any time at all on religious and spiritual activity on the day in question.

The graph shows how such participation increases from less than 10% of 20-year-olds, to 20% or more of the oldest survey respondents.  It should be noted that the data for the very oldest respondents --- those aged 80 and over --- is less reliable than at other ages, partly because of small numbers and partly because of the rounded recording of older ages in the published ATUS data.
    
**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

   ![Danius' graph showing the relationship between age and time spent on education](DaniusBackisplotfinal.svg)

The graph above depicts the relationship between the average time spent on educational activities and the age of the respondents. As one would expect, the younger the respondent, the more they spend time educating themselves. The maximum is attained at 17 years old, when people spend on average 200 minutes per day on education, and then it drops quickly. 7 years later, less than 24 minutes per day are spent on education. It can also be noted that from 50 years old participants practically never spend time on education, which I found quite surprising.

![James's graph of household care vs age and gender](James-plot.svg)

The above figure conveys an inequality in both gender and age of individuals caring for members within the American home. Participants of the 2017 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) were expected to note how many hours of the day before their interview they had spent on various tasks. In the graph, we may see the proportion of the total reported hours directed to this care, split by age and sex.

Of all reported hours caring for others within their home, across almost all ages, females (grey) report a higher number of hours than males (pink). Secondly, younger woman (25-35) spend considerably more time on this task than men of the same age range. Interestingly, men do show a clear peak in their late thirties, perhaps correlated to their aging parents seeking their help. The trend lines are provided solely for illustrative purposes of indicating the distinct differences in proportions, as they have not been statistically scrutinized. Similarly, the tails of these rough distributions, and hence these data, should be considered somewhat unreliable due to small sample size within these age ranges.

The plot shows the proportion of time people spend on sports and recreation as opposed to education. Note that only people included in this plot are those who _are_ in education. All respondents were specified to have an age under 25, so the graph isn't clouded by the many ages that are not in education. 
The graph shows that males between the 15-17 age bracket spend far more on recreational activites, since the values for these ages fall above the 0.5 line. As the age increases, the proportions through the ages fall together; reason for this could include and increase in difficulty relating to higher eduation.
For females however, the proportion does not change much over time, perhaps due to female students being more motivated in school.
