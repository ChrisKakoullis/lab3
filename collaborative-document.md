### David

 530       Staffordshire South

![David's graph of West Midlands constituencies](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the West Midlands region, the relationship between electoral change (between Conservative and Labour parties, at the 2015 and 2017 General Elections) and the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census.

Perhaps surprisingly, gains for Labour (over the Conservatives) appear to have been largest in those West Midlands seats where there were fewest young people resident according to the census.

The majority of West Midlands constituencies show some gain for Labour over Conservative.  The *Staffordshire South* constituency, highlighted in red in the plot, appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

### Nayia
57 Birmingham Edgbaston

![Nayia's graph (also) of West Midlands constituencies](NayiaC-plot.svg)

Same plot as Prof. Firth's above but now the *Birmingham Edgbaston* constituency is highlighted in red in the plot. 

The *Birmingham Edgbaston* constituency is similar to the majority of constituencies with regards to the Relative LabCon vote ratios between 2015 and 2017, as it shows some gain for Labour over Conservative. However, it differs from the majority of constituencies with regards to the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census in the West Midlands, as it is one of the 4 consituencies with the largest percentage of young people (above 15%).

 I have looked further into the patterns of young voters in the East Midlands. This plot shows the relationship between electoral turnout changes (between the 2015 and 2017 general elections) and the percentage of the population aged between 18 and 24 from the 2011 census. 

As expected, electoral turnout tended to increase sharply in the constituencies of the East Midlands which had higher percentages of young voters in 2011. However, in all but five East Midland constintuencies there was a increase in percentage turnout in 2017 compared with 2015. 

Northampton South, highlighted in red, showed very typical results for the East Midlands. To build upon these findings I would suggest finding out the proportion of teenagers in each constituency to see if this affects my findings.

### Alice

 289      Hampshire North West

 This plot shows the relationship between the increase of each party's percentage of votes for the 2015 and 2017 General Elections, against the estimated percentage of 'Leave' votes in the 2016 EU Referendum. The lines that have been plotted are based on all of the constituencies in the South East. It also highlights the data points that represent the Hampshire North West data for this relationship.

Labour is the only party to not see a decrease in vote percentage across all constituencies, and has the largest increase at all points. However, when considering Hampshire North West, there is not as large an increase as the plot would suggest for a constituency with a Leave percentage of that size. Looking at the plot, a possible explanation for this could be that both the percentages for UKIP and the Lib Dems have not decreased as much as would be expected.

Another interesting pattern in this plot is the almost symmetric shapes of the Conservative and UKIP lines which becomes more pronounced where the Leave percentage is higher. This could suggest that lots of people who voted UKIP in 2015 and supported the outcome of the EU Referendum, then transferred their support to the Conservative Party in the 2017 Election.

This plot shows the relationship between the estimated percentage of voters voting to leave in the 2016 EU election and the percentage of the population with a degree in the 2011 census, for the London region with Enfield North highlighted in red. 
  
A negative correlation is shown in the plot, with the estimated percent of the population that voted leave being highest in the constituencies with the lowest percentage of the population with a degree. Moreover, the lower estimated percentages voting leave occurs in the constituencies with the highest percentage of the population with a degree. The Enfield North constituency has a lower percentage of the population with a degree than the majority of the London constituencies. With an estimation of just under 50% of the population voting to leave, Enfield North fits with the overall trend of the plot.

 Young voter turnout is often very low in elections, so it is not surprising to see that there is a positive correlation between non-voting and there being a lot of young people in a constituency.

Nottingham East had a very high number of people aged 18-24 compared to other constituencies in the 2011 census and also had a very high percentage of non-voters in the 2015 General Election.

### Kevin

 293 Harrogate & Knaresborough

![Kevin's graph of Yorkshire and the Humber constituencies](KevinC-plot_2.svg)

It can be observed that in all but two constituencies (Rotherham and Wentworth & Dearne) the labour to lib dem voter ratio has increased. In particular, Rotheram and Wentworth & Dearne both have very small lib dem vote share compared to labour's vote share.

Interestingly, there is a constituency, Bradford East, where the relative vote ratio is up to 22.4. Looking carefully at the data, this is mainly because the Lib Dems only retained 6.89% of their 2015 votes (a drop of 27.7 percentage points in absolute terms), whilst labour had a gain of 54.5% of their 2015 votes (an increase of 18.7 percentage points in absolute terms). This extraordinary change may be due to Lib Dem's 2015 candidate decided to stand as an Independent, retaining a 7.8% vote share in 2017.

We can observe that Harrogate fits well into the pattern for the relative vote ratio, with a value of 1.86. Although in this constituency, there was a gain in Lib Dem votes, there had been an even larger gain for labour, in both relative and absolute terms. Moreover, Harrogate was the only constituency in the whole region where the Lib Dem vote was higher than the Labour vote in 2017! This compared to 2015 when the Lib Dems had two seats in this region - Greg Mulholland in Leeds North West and Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam.

### Kishan

  38                 Battersea

![Kishan's graph of the London constituencies.](KishanRadia-plot.png)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the "London" region, the relationship between electorate size and the total number of votes counted. In particular, we are looking at the changes between the 2015 and 2017 general elections.

As expected, for all constituencies in which the registered electorate size increased, the total number of votes at election did as well. However in over a quarter of the "London" constituencies, where the electorate size decreased, we also saw an increase in the total number of votes counted (there were no "London" constituencies where the total votes decreased). The most extreme case showed an increase of votes by over 10%, alongside a decrease of electorate size by over 10%.

As for the Battersea case, highlighted in red in the plot, this constituency appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

### Lewis

 563 Tatton

 This graph shows a connection between the number of UKIP voters in 2015, 2017 and the EU election in between. It demonstrates a number of interesting things and raises some key points

The first thing to note is quite intuitive, UKIP had a huge reduction in followers between 2015 and 2017, so much so, there was no consituency that had lost any less than 2000 voters. In the North-West specifically, not a single area held the same number of voters from 2 years prior.

Moving onto the correlation of the graph itself. It is clear there is a positive correlation between the proportion of people voting to leave the European Union and the numebr of UKIP voters lost in the 2 years between 2015 and 2017. Looking into why this may be makes it clear why. UKIP had a very strong Brexit campaign, stronger than any other party at that time in fact. So any person who was looking to leave the EU went to UKIP to push Brexit as there was nowhere else. Coming around to the 2017 election once '#Leave' had been initiated, there were other parties happy to 'take the reigns', with the option of other parties that the public might relate to more people moved away from UKIP to bigger parties likely to move into parliament that would also move forward with leaving the European union.
 
 

### Matt D

 591                 Wakefield

![Matt's graph of Yorkshire & the Humber constituencies](MattD-plot.svg)

The graph shows, for all constituencies in Yorkshire and the Humber region, there is a positive relationship between the percentage of leave Brexit votes in 2016 and the percentage of UKIP voters in the general election of 2015. Wakefield specifically also follows this trend.

The likely reason for this relationship is that UKIP were extremely pro-Brexit, meaning that people that voted for them will likely have a similar opinion and will want to leave the EU.

It also appears that the majority of constituencies in Yorkshire and the Humber region were in favour for leaving the EU since they have more than 50% of voters voting leave. However, the percentage of people voting UKIP is extremely small, the most being a little over 0.3%. This is likely due to few people agreeing with the other extremist views despite the high percentage of pro-Brexit voters within the region.

![Tina's graph of East Midlands constituencies](TinaG-plot.svg)

This is a plot of the East Midlands constituencies showing the relationship between electoral change, (between Conservative and Labour party; a higher value on the y-axis corresponds to gains for Labour relative to the Conservatives), during the 2015 and 2017 general elections and the percentage of the electorate who voted in each constituency for Brexit in the 2016 referendum. 

In the East Midlands, as the number of Brexiteers increases, Labour loses seats to the Conservatives. This is not surprising since the Labour party campaigned heavily to remain in the EU. 

In most of the East Midland constituencies Labour gained against Conservatives. *Charnwood*, highlighted in orange, seems to be a fairly typical constituency based on the data provided on these two variables.
