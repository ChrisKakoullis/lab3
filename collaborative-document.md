![David's graph of religious participation vs age](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows how participation in religious and spiritual activity in the USA is different at different ages.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which
respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.
The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages, who reported that they had spent any time at all on religious and spiritual activity on the day in question.

The graph shows how such participation increases from less than 10% of 20-year-olds, to 20% or more of the oldest survey respondents.  It should be noted that the data for the very oldest respondents --- those aged 80 and over --- is less reliable than at other ages, partly because of small numbers and partly because of the rounded recording of older ages in the published ATUS data.
    
**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

![Nathan's graph of time spent on socialising, relaxing and leisure vs age](NathanM-plot.svg)

This graph shows how the amount of time spent on socialising, relaxing and leisure (SR&L) in the USA differs depending on whether or not a person undertakes volunteer activities. The data used to produce this graphic is from the 2017 _American Time Use Survey_, in which respondents were asked to record which activities they had undertaken the previous day, and for how long. 

\
From the graph it can be seen that, regardless of gender, respondents who spent any amount of time volunteering on a given day spent noticeably less time on SR&L than those not volunteering.

\
Looking at males, the amount of time spent by volunteers on SR&L, on a given day, follows a very similar trend to that of non-volunteers. In fact, it appears as though the trend for volunteers is, for the most part, a scaled down version of the trend for non-volunteers. The only noticeable difference is when we look at males over the age of 70. 
\
For males over 70 the amount of time spent by volunteers on SR&L deviates from the trend observed in non-volunteers; as age increases there is a decrease in the amount of time spent by volunteering males on SR&L. A possible explanation is the wide 95% confidence interval, which suggests that the number of volunteering males over 70 was comparatively small to the number of volunteers under the age of 70.

\
Contrary to males, the trend for female volunteers does not match that of the female non-volunteers very closely. This is particularly true for females under the age of 30. The 95% confidence interval of volunteering females is much wider than that of non-volunteers. This suggests that out of all female respondents relatively few of them under the age of 30 engaged in volunteering, on a given day.
