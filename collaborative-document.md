![David's graph of religious participation vs age](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows how participation in religious and spiritual activity in the USA is different at different ages.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which
respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.
The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages, who reported that they had spent any time at all on religious and spiritual activity on the day in question.

The graph shows how such participation increases from less than 10% of 20-year-olds, to 20% or more of the oldest survey respondents.  It should be noted that the data for the very oldest respondents --- those aged 80 and over --- is less reliable than at other ages, partly because of small numbers and partly because of the rounded recording of older ages in the published ATUS data.
    
**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

    ![Jia Le's graph of spending time consumer purchases against age, per month](JiaLian-plot.svg)
This plot illustrates the proportion of males and females who spent time on making consumer purchases by age, on a monthly basis. The data is taken from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, which recorded the time spent by individuals on the day before their interview. 

In general, the proportion of individual who spent time purchasing consumer goods increases with age, peaking at around 40 years old. This is followed by a downward slope as we move towards the 60-80 age range. This could be explained by elder people having restricted mobility compared to younger people, thus many of them no longer spent time on consumer purchases. 

It is also evident that, there is a larger proportion of female who spent time on making consumer purchases than male as the red lines are mostly above the blue lines. Besides, it is interesting to observe that there is a largest difference in proportion of men and women, aged between 20 and 40, who spent time on consumer purchases in February and April whereas, there is least difference in the proportion in May and December. 

It should be noted that there are more females who spent time on consumer purchases and data from those aged over 80 is less reliable because of rounding and there are only a small number of them.
